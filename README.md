# DragonFire Pizza v2

a modern, feature-rich pizza ordering and management system built on the Laravel framework. This project aims to deliver a seamless pizza ordering experience for customers while providing robust administration tools for managing toppings, menus, and user permissions.

## Project Goals

- **Toppings Management**: Implement a flexible toppings table allowing seamless association with pre-made pizzas, providing administrators the ability to manage toppings availability based on season and preference.

- **Implement Many to Many pivot table**: Create a pivot table that connects two other tables such as "pizza" and "toppings".

- **User-Friendly Administration**: Design an intuitive administration interface empowering admins to effortlessly control topping selections available to customers, ensuring a delightful ordering experience.

- **Simplified User Assignment**: Utilize ENUM for streamlined assignment of user roles, making the management process straightforward and efficient.

- **Database Population with Seeders**: Employ Laravel seeders to populate the database with a comprehensive list of toppings, expediting the setup process for new installations.

- **Authentication with Laravel Breeze**: Leverage Laravel Breeze to gain hands-on experience with authentication mechanisms, enhancing security and user management capabilities.

- **Enhanced Routing with Laravel**: Explore routing features using authentication and the resource keyword, facilitating the implementation of basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **AI-Driven Design**: Craft the pizzeria website based on AI-generated mockups, harnessing artificial intelligence to streamline navigation and color selection, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing user experience.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
